- Check all cards that display input and output - should be able to set output 
  on connect and pick up local value at subscribe rather than setting local value
  manually as doesn't account for values already on line. Careful though: some cards
  have diodes to stop this backfeed by design
- Simplify cards using x and xOut where could use xOut for both.
- Try and reduce chattyness of Observables
- Add comments in all classes
- Push construction of factories to very top of app (or let DI do it)
- Compose some of the BitValue operations which are currently being done outside of class

- Add Memory Card + display showing contents of memory
- Add PC
- Add Inc
- Update control to work through memory
- Add way of uploading opcodes in to memory (written in binary)
- Add way of uploading ops (MOV B,A) to memory 
- Add way of writing assembly (with intellisense) that compiles in to memory

TODO on real relay computer:
