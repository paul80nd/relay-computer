    <h3>Relay Computer Simulator</h3>
    <p>This is a simulation of my relay computer using angular and SVG. Mainly I'm using it to learn and practice those dev
        frameworks but this also provides me a way of virtually refining the next part of my relay computer without having
        to spend the time and expense of experimenting for real.</p>
    <p>More information on my relay computer can be found at my <a target="_blank" href="https://relaycomputer.co.uk">blog</a>.</p>
    <p>If you would like to dive straight in and have a go on this simulator there is a tutorial section following the operating
        instructions below</p>
    <h5>Operating Instructions</h5>
    <p>Most parts of the computer can be operated manually by using the switches in Display A (at the top left). Click a switch
        once to turn it on and again to turn it off. When that line is active the switch lights up.</p>
    <p>The primary switches are below Display A. Click a switch to turn it on (black circle is up) and again to turn it off
        (black circle is down). The 'Deposit' and 'Exam' switches can be pushed up or down by clicking on the upper or lower
        half. The remaining switches can be turned on by clicking anywhere within the switch. The 'Dep Next' and switches
        to the right are all momentary and will reset to off after a short pause.</p>
    <h5>Tutorial</h5>
    <p>Assuming the simulator is in its default state (refresh this page to re-default it if not) you can follow this tutorial
        to perform a simple arithmetic sequence of ((2 + 4 + 1) x 3) - 3. This will allow you to try out the three instruction
        classes currently supported by the computer</p>
    <p>Here are the steps that make up the program using the three instruction classes ALU, MOVE8 and SETAB:</p>
    <pre><code> SETAB B &lt;- 2       2 + 4 = 6
 SETAB A &lt;- 4
 MOVE8 C &lt;- A
 ALU   A &lt;- ADD
  
 MOVE8 B &lt;- A       6 + 1 = 7
 ALU   A &lt;- INC
  
 MOVE8 B &lt;- A       7 * 3 = 21
 MOVE8 C &lt;- A
 ALU   A &lt;- ADD
 MOVE8 B &lt;- A
 ALU   A &lt;- ADD
  
 SETAB B &lt;- 3       Negate 3
 ALU   D &lt;- NOT
 MOVE8 B &lt;- D
 ALU   D &lt;- INC
 MOVE8 B &lt;- A       21 - 3 = 18
 MOVE8 C &lt;- D
 ALU   A &lt;- ADD</code></pre>
    <p>
        Using the list of instructions each line of this program can be converted in to the binary opcode equivalent as follows:
    </p>
    <pre><code> 01100010       2 + 4 = 6
 01000100
 00010000
 10000001
  
 00001000       6 + 1 = 7
 10000010
  
 00001000       7 * 3 = 21
 00010000
 10000001
 00001000
 10000001
  
 01100011       Negate 3
 10001110
 00001011
 10001010
 00001000       21 - 3 = 18
 00010011
 10000001
 
 00011000       Move A to D</code></pre>
    <p>
        I've added an additional instruction at the end of the program here to copy the result (of 18) to register D from register
        A. This is needed as there currently isn't a way to tell the computer the program has ended and so it'll carry on
        executing the instructions in memory. In the simulator each instruction will be all zeros (assuming the simulator
        has been reset beforehand) and 00000000 is the opcode for MOVE8 from A to A which effectively clears the current
        value in register A. By copying the value to D first it ensures the result isn't lost.
    </p>
    <p>
        To load this program in to memory, line-by-line, set the black primary switches to match the opcode and then flick the 'DEP
        NEXT' switch which will load the instrucion into memory and then advance the program counter. Just keep setting the
        primary switches and flicking 'DEP NEXT' until all opcodes have been entered. Once the program is loaded you should
        see the following values in the memory view:
    </p>
    <pre><code> 000  62 44 10 81 08 82 08 10
      81 08 81 63 8E 0B 8A 08
 001  13 81 18 00 00 00 00 00
      00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00</code></pre>
    <p>
        This is the hexadecimal representation of each 8-bit opcode loaded in to memory. To execute the program first set all the black
        switches back to 0 and flick the 'LOAD ADDR' switch to reset the program counter back to the first position in memory.
        To prime the sequencer flick the 'RSET' switch which sets the 'S00' light in the sequencer. You can now flick the RUN/STOP switch
        to RUN and the program will begin executing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the program keeps running the MOVE8 A &lt;- A instruction (00000000) you should see the result value of 18 (00010010) in register D.
        If you stop the clock (flick RUN/STOP to STOP) and manually clock (with CLK) to a point where nothing is on the data bus you can select 
        register D to see the value on the data bus.
    </p>
