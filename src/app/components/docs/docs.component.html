    <h3>Relay Computer Simulator</h3>
    <p>
        <b>New: Tutorial below now uses branching to calculate the Fibonacci sequence!</b>
    </p>
    <p>This is a simulation of my relay computer using angular and SVG. Mainly I'm using it to learn and practice those dev
        frameworks but this also provides me a way of virtually refining the next part of my relay computer without having
        to spend the time and expense of experimenting for real.</p>
    <p>More information on my relay computer can be found at my <a target="_blank" href="https://relaycomputer.co.uk">blog</a>.</p>
    <p>If you would like to dive straight in and have a go on this simulator there is a tutorial section following the operating
        instructions below</p>
    <h5>Operating Instructions</h5>
    <p>Most parts of the computer can be operated manually by using the switches in Display A (at the top left). Click a switch
        once to turn it on and again to turn it off. When that line is active the switch lights up.</p>
    <p>The primary switches are below Display A. Click a switch to turn it on (black circle is up) and again to turn it off
        (black circle is down). The 'Deposit' and 'Exam' switches can be pushed up or down by clicking on the upper or lower
        half. The remaining switches can be turned on by clicking anywhere within the switch. The 'Dep Next' and switches
        to the right are all momentary and will reset to off after a short pause.</p>
    <h5>Tutorial</h5>
    <p>Assuming the simulator is in its default state (refresh this page to re-default it if not) you can follow this tutorial
        to perform a calculation of the fibonacci sequence up to 233 (as that is the largest fibonacci number that can fit in an
        8-bit register). This will allow you to try out the four instruction classes currently supported by the computer and
        uses the newly added branching (GOTO) instruction.
    </p>
    <p>Here are the steps that make up the program using the four instruction classes ALU, MOVE8, GOTO and SETAB:</p>
    <pre><code> 0000 SETAB A = 1  ; Initalise A = B = 1
 0001 MOV8  B = A
  
 0002 MOV8  C = B  ; C = B then B = A
 0003 MOV8  B = A
 0004 ALU   ADD    ; A = B + C

 0005 GOTO  0005 C ; Loop forever if add
                   ; caused an overflow
                   ; otherwise ...

 0008 GOTO  0002   ; Jump back to line 2
                   ; and repeat for next
                   ; number in series</code></pre>
    <p>
        Using the list of instructions each line of this program can be converted in to the binary opcode equivalent as follows:
    </p>
    <pre><code> 0000 01000001 ; SETAB A = 1
 0001 00001000 ; MOV8  B = A
        
 0002 00010001 ; MOV8  C = B
 0003 00001000 ; MOV8  B = A
 0004 10000001 ; ALU   ADD

 0005 11101000 ; GOTO  0005 C
 0006 00000000
 0007 00000101
 
 0008 11100110 ; GOTO  0002
 0009 00000000
 000A 00000010</code></pre>
    <p>
        Because the computer hasn't got a HALT instruction yet it's necessary to put it in an infinite loop when the add
        operation causes an overflow (at which point the last result we got of 233 is as high as we can count in a single
        8-bit register).
    </p>
    <p>
        To load this program in to memory, line-by-line, set the black primary switches to match the opcode and then flick the 'DEP
        NEXT' switch which will load the instrucion into memory and then advance the program counter. Just keep setting the
        primary switches and flicking 'DEP NEXT' until all opcodes have been entered. Once the program is loaded you should
        see the following values in the memory view:
    </p>
    <pre><code> 000  41 08 11 08 81 E8 00 05
      E6 00 02 00 00 00 00 00
 001  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
      00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
 ...</code></pre>
    <p>
        This is the hexadecimal representation of each 8-bit opcode loaded in to memory. To execute the program first set all the black
        switches back to 0 and flick the 'LOAD ADDR' switch to reset the program counter back to the first position in memory.
        To prime the sequencer flick the 'RSET' switch which sets the 'S00' light in the sequencer. You can now flick the RUN/STOP switch
        to RUN and the program will begin executing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Immediately following each ALU ADD you'll find the next sequence number in register A. The sequence starts with 1 loaded in to
        register B and C so the sequence in register A goes 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233 at which point the program then
        loops endlessly when the next value (377) causes an overflow.
