# relay-computer
This is a simulation of my relay computer using angular and SVG. Mainly I'm using it to learn angular, javascript and SVG but this also provides me a way of refining the next part of my relay computer without having to resort to lots of nasty desoldering.

More information on my relay computer can be found at my [blog](http://relaycomputer.blogspot.co.uk)
