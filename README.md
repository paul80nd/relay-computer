# relay-computer
This is a simulation of my relay computer using angular and SVG. Mainly I'm using it to learn angular, javascript and SVG but this also provides me a way of refining the next part of my relay computer without having to resort to lots of nasty desoldering.

More information on my relay computer can be found at my [blog](https://relaycomputer.co.uk)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

If the built project will not be hosted at the root url then it can be built as follows, for example, `ng build --prod --base-href https://simulator.relaycomputer.co.uk`

## Deploy

Once built the app can be deployed to the Github Pages branch with
`npx angular-cli-ghpages --dir=dist --cname=simulator.relaycomputer.co.uk`

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
